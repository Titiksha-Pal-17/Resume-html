Hi, I'm Titiksha Pal, a passionate and dedicated web developer with 3 years of experience in creating dynamic, user-friendly websites and web applications. My journey into web development began with a love for coding and a fascination with how the web works. Over the years, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies, with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js.

I thrive on solving complex problems and bringing innovative ideas to life through clean, efficient code. Whether it's designing a seamless user interface or building robust server-side applications, I take pride in delivering high-quality, responsive, and accessible web solutions.

I'm a strong communicator and team player, always eager to collaborate and share knowledge with others. I believe in continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new coding challenges, contributing to open-source projects, and expanding my skill set.

Let's build something amazing together!
